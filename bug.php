This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the unset() function on array elements within a foreach loop.  When unset() is called on an array element during iteration, the internal array pointer of the foreach loop may become invalid, leading to unexpected results or skipped elements. The foreach loop will skip elements after the unset operation.

```php
<?php
$myArray = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    if ($value % 2 == 0) {
        unset($myArray[$key]);
    }
}

print_r($myArray); // Output: Array ( [0] => 1 [2] => 3 [4] => 5 ) 
?>
```
